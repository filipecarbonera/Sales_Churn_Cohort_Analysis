[Link to the Medium article explaining how to replicate this analysis.](https://medium.com/@filipecarbonera/how-to-create-a-sales-and-churn-cohort-analysis-in-looker-studio-bb56f1bd3f90)

The main goal of this article is to explain how to create a sales (or subscriptions) and churn cohort analysis dashboard with pivot tables at Looker Studio (formerly, Data Studio).

The data used to create the query and the dashboard are fictional and created simply to adapt easily to many business cases.

The final result of this analysis can be found in [this link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/77644a55-7617-4111-8419-b14839c618b4/page/p_wziz1f120c).

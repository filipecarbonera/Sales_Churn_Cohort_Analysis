The main goal of this article is to explain how to create a sales (or subscriptions) and churn cohort analysis dashboard with pivot tables at Looker Studio (formerly, Data Studio).

- The data used to create the query and the dashboard are fictional and created simply to adapt easily to many business cases.
- The SQL query used in this analysis can be found in the _creating_final_table.sql_ file in this repository.

- The final result of this analysis can be found in [this link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/77644a55-7617-4111-8419-b14839c618b4/page/p_wziz1f120c).
